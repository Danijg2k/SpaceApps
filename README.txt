You can proceed in two different ways:

-Space_apps.jar can be directly executed with command line. 

-If you are going to use the space_apps folder you will need Eclipse Developer, and also Spring Tools 4, a library that can be downloaded in Eclipse's marketplace. You just need to import the project.


We also inserted a video we made about how it works locally.
